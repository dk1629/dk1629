- 👋 Hi, My name is Dario
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in Natural Language Processing besides being an AI enthusiast and a Pythonista 
- 🌱 I’m currently working as an AI programmer and on my PhD thesis in Linguistics.
- 👨‍💻 My projects on GitHub are mostly boilerplate code that i reuse in other projects and generic repositories from online courses, but I will try to publish more work from private repositories and several other projects, such as http://www.multidis.erf.hr/
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects within the NLP field, especially with semantic/pragmatic analysis, predictions, automated annotations and integrating with knowledge bases
